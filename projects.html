            <h3>Help Application</h3>
            <p>This is a job search website that uses different technologies to calculate the distance between the address in the user's profile and the work location.
                This application was created using Python Flask framework and was hosted on AWS EC2 server. MongoDB was used to store data, and also hosted on an EC2 server.
            </p>
            <p> Python - Flask, Bootcamp, Google Map, Gunicorn, MongoDB.</p>

            <h3>Timing channel Security for NoC Router</h3>
            <p>This project was implemented to secure the vulnerabilities that attackers
                exploit in On-chip Networks routers. VHDL was used to build build and modify both 
                packet switching and circuit switching routers by partitioning the routings on the 
                network to security levels, and using methodologies like TDM, granted request based on 
                security levels to allow certain security level packets to be propagated in the network. 
                Y-X routing algorithm was used to route the packets from a source node(router) to the destination node

            <h3>Book Catalogue</h3>
            <p>This application was based on model-driven software development.
                We created a class diagram that depicts each class on the system and the relationship between them which were accurately
                reflected in our development.</p>
