HTML 5 meta elements viewport, description bla bla

Div class id vs class: id is unique (to be only used uniquley). Class can be used over and over again

nav - navigation

ul - unordered list

li - list item

<a href: 

section: usually showcase area under header

<span> is an in-line level element. It's not going to make go into the next line

All of these above are called markup. 

CSS

In CSS font-family, font-size and line-height can me written as:

font: font-size/line-height font-family;

Container is a class...use a period

when you have an Id ....use # sign

use percentage value with the width to make respnsive

min-height = helps adjust the height in responsive website.


After the design is complete...time to make it look good on mobile device. What we need to do is use media queries. 

We can set media queries to basically state that these group of css would only work if that screen is at a certain width. 

Example:

@media(max-width: 768px){
  body{
    display: none;;
  }
}

From the example above...The body only displays when the screen is greater than or equal to 768px
